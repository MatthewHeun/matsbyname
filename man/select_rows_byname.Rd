\title{Select (or de-select) rows of a matrix (or list of matrices) by name}
\usage{
select_rows_byname(a, retain_pattern = "$^", remove_pattern = "$^")
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A matrix or a list of matrices.}

\item{retain_pattern}{An extended regex or list of extended regular expressions that specifies which rows of \code{a} to retain.
Default pattern ("$^") retains nothing.}

\item{remove_pattern}{An extended regex or list of extended regular expressions that specifies which rows of \code{a} to remove,
Default pattern ("$^") removes nothing.}
}
\value{
A matrix that is a subset of \code{m} with rows selected by \code{retain_pattern} and \code{remove_pattern}.
}
\description{
Arguments indicate which rows are to be retained and which are to be removed.
For maximum flexibility, arguments are extended regex patterns
that are matched against row names.
}
\details{
If \code{a} is \code{NULL}, \code{NULL} is returned.

Patterns are compared against row names using extended regex.
If no row names of \code{a} match the \code{retain_pattern}, \code{NULL} is returned.
If no row names of \code{a} match the \code{remove_pattern}, \code{m} is returned.
Note that the default \code{retain_pattern} and \code{remove_pattern} ("$^")
retain nothing and remove nothing.

Retaining rows takes precedence over removing rows, always.

Some typical patterns are:
\itemize{
\item{"^Electricity$|^Oil$": row names that are EXACTLY "Electricity" or EXACTLY "Oil".}
\item{"^Electricity|^Oil": row names that START WITH "Electricity" or START WITH "Oil".}
\item{"Electricity|Oil": row names that CONTAIN "Electricity" or CONTAIN "Oil" anywhere within them.}
}

Given a list of row names, a pattern can be constructed easily using \code{RCLabels::make_or_pattern()}.
\code{RCLabels::make_or_pattern()} escapes regex strings using \code{Hmisc::escapeRegex()}.
This function assumes that \code{retain_pattern} and \code{remove_pattern} have already been
suitably escaped.

If the row or column labels contain "[" or "]",
care should be taken to escape those characters.
\code{Hmisc::escapeRegex()} is helpful in such situations.

Note that if all rows are removed from \code{a}, \code{NULL} is returned.

m <- matrix(1:16, ncol = 4, dimnames = list(c(paste0("i", 1:4)), paste0("p", 1:4))) \%>\%
  setrowtype("Industries") \%>\% setcoltype("Commodities")
select_rows_byname(m, 
                   retain_pattern = RCLabels::make_or_pattern(c("i1", "i4"),
                   pattern_type = "exact"))
select_rows_byname(m, 
                   remove_pattern = RCLabels::make_or_pattern(c("i1", "i3"), 
                   pattern_type = "exact"))
# Also works for lists and data frames
select_rows_byname(list(m, m), retain_pattern = "^i1$|^i4$")
